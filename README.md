## 👋 About Me

I'm a **B.Tech ECE student at IIIT Bhopal** who likes working close to the system layer —
APIs, async workflows, real-time communication, and AI pipelines.

I’ve worked on **healthcare platforms**, **developer tools**, and **competitive programming systems**, often combining:
- strong backend fundamentals
- real-time infrastructure
- practical GenAI integrations

I also actively practice **DSA & competitive programming** (3★ CodeChef), which heavily influences how I design systems.

## 🛠️ Tech I Work With

**Backend:** Node.js, Express, FastAPI, Redis, MongoDB  
**Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS  
**Real-Time:** WebSockets, Socket.IO, WebRTC  
**AI / GenAI:** LangChain, LangGraph, RAG Pipelines, OpenAI, Gemini  
**Languages:** Java, JavaScript, Python, C  
**Foundations:** DSA, OOP, DBMS, OS, Computer Networks

## 💼 Experience (Quick Context)

**Resonate Health — SWE Intern**  
Worked on production backend systems for diagnostics and fitness data.  
Most of my work revolves around **data ingestion**, **AI-based parsing**, and **reliable pipelines** for health data like lab reports and Google Fit metrics.

**DWARF AI — Full Stack AI Intern**  
Built and shipped an AI-powered healthcare platform where users could upload reports and interact with them via text and voice.  
This role gave me deep exposure to **RAG pipelines**, **session-based AI chat systems**, and end-to-end GenAI product development.

## 🚀 Projects I’m Proud Of

### 🟣 KodeKshetra
A **real-time competitive programming platform** where users battle 1v1 on DSA problems.

The interesting part wasn’t just the UI — it was designing:
- sandboxed code execution
- real-time matchmaking
- scalable backend services
- and AI-powered test case generation

This project reflects how I think about **systems, fairness, and real-time performance**.

### ♟️ Chess With Benefits
A multiplayer chess platform that mixes **real-time communication + AI**.

Along with live games, users can:
- talk over video/audio (WebRTC)
- control moves via voice
- get AI-generated commentary and move analysis

This project pushed me to understand **low-latency systems** and real-time user experience deeply.

## 🧠 How I Think

- I prefer **simple, reliable systems** over clever but fragile ones  
- I like understanding **why** something works, not just **how**  
- Competitive programming has shaped how I approach performance and edge cases  
- AI is most interesting to me when it **actually improves a product**, not when it’s just a feature checkbox
