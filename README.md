### 👋 About Me

I'm a **B.Tech ECE student at IIIT Bhopal** who likes working close to how systems
actually run — APIs, async workflows, real-time communication, and AI pipelines.

I’ve built things in **healthcare**, **developer tooling**, and
**competitive programming**, often mixing:
- strong computer science fundamentals  
- reliable backend engineering  
- real-time infrastructure  
- applied GenAI (not demos)

Competitive programming (**3★ CodeChef**) strongly influences how I think about
performance, correctness, and edge cases.

## 🧠 My Engineering Toolkit (Beyond Frameworks)

Instead of just listing tools, this is **how I use them**:

- **Programming Languages**  
  Java (DSA & system logic), JavaScript (full-stack), Python (AI & backend services), C (low-level understanding)

- **Backend Engineering**  
  Building APIs with Node.js & FastAPI, handling async workflows, caching with Redis, and designing data models with MongoDB

- **Frontend Development**  
  Creating clean, responsive UIs using React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS — mostly as a delivery layer over strong backends

- **AI & GenAI Systems**  
  Designing **RAG pipelines**, working with **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, **LangSmith**, **Langfuse**, and applying prompt engineering to make LLM outputs reliable and useful

- **Core Computer Science**  
  Data Structures & Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming, DBMS & SQL, Operating Systems, and Computer Networks — these guide most of my design decisions

- **Developer Tools**  
  Git & GitHub for collaboration, Postman for API testing, and VS Code as my daily driver

## 💼 Experience (Quick Context)

**Resonate Health — SWE Intern**  
I work on production backend systems related to diagnostics and fitness data.
Most of my work involves designing **reliable ingestion pipelines**, **AI-based parsing systems**, and
fault-tolerant workflows where correctness really matters.

**DWARF AI — Full Stack AI Intern**  
I helped build and ship an AI-powered healthcare platform end-to-end.
This experience exposed me to **RAG systems**, **session-based AI chat**, and
what it takes to move a GenAI product beyond a prototype.

## 🚀 Projects I’m Proud Of

### 🟣 KodeKshetra
A **real-time competitive programming platform** where users battle 1v1 on DSA problems.

This project pushed me to think deeply about:
real-time matchmaking, sandboxed code execution, scalable backend services,
and AI-assisted problem evaluation.

### ♟️ Chess With Benefits
A multiplayer chess platform combining **real-time systems** with **AI-driven insights**.

Players can communicate via video/audio, use voice-based controls,
and receive AI-generated commentary — all while keeping latency low.

## 🧠 How I Think About Building

- Simple systems that work > complex systems that break  
- Performance, correctness, and edge cases matter  
- Real-time systems force discipline in design  
- AI should **improve UX**, not just exist
